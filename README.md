# christmas_exchange
Secret Santa gift exchange that randomly assigns who everyone has and makes sure that 1) there are no doubles and 2) no one is left out!

Details:
I wrote this program 2 years ago using C++ and it was much more complicated. I have now translated it into Python and want to keep working on making it cleaner, more beautiful, and more functional.
